<p class="intro">
    <a href="http://isis.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Isis</a>&trade; is a platform to let you rapidly develop
    domain-driven apps in Java.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    This example app demonstrates the Incode' <a href="https://github.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification" target="_blank">Classification Module</a>,
    configured for a very simple and purposefully minimal application.  The application demonstrates the ability to classify any (arbitrary) domain object
    against a pre-defined set of categorizations available for that type of domain object.  A <code>CharacterizationCategory</code> defines a particular
    classification (similar to an enum), eg "PrivilegeLevel" and applies to a specified domain type (eg Customer).  A <code>CharacterizationValue</code> is a particular value within that classification (similar to an enum instance), eg "PrivilegeValue#GOLD", and applies to a specific instance of the domain type (eg "John Doe: Customer").
    <br>
    <br>
    The module depends on the <a href="https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-poly" target="_blank">poly module</a> (polymorphic association pattern)</a>.
