This module, intended for use with link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides the ability to classify any
(arbitrary) domain object against a pre-defined set of classifications available for that type of domain object (and
application tenancy).  There are _no_ requirements for those domain objects implement any interfaces.
A subclass of the `ClassificationLink` abstract class (about 40 lines of boilerplate, details below) is required,
acting as the "glue" between the classification and the "classified" domain object.


== Screenshots

NOTE: TODO - incomplete and missing screenshots

The following screenshots show an example app's usage of the module.

We start by installing some demo fixture data:

This installs some very simple (demo) "classified" domain objects, the first of which is returned.  These classified
domain objects have a (contributed) `classifications` collection, and we can also add new classifications using a
(contributed) `classify(...)` action:

== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x or later is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/incodehq/isis-module-classification.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn antrun:run -P self-host
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`



== Domain Model

The following `yuml.me` class diagram highlights the main concepts:

image::http://yuml.me/2a277faf[link="http://yuml.me/2a277faf"]

(The colours used in the diagram are - approximately - from link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Modeling_in_Color[Object Modeling in Color].


=== `Classification`

The `Classification` entity defines a hierarchy of classifications (another term might be "taxonomy").  In many cases
this will be only two levels deep, in effect defining a enum, eg:

* `Color` root classification, with children:
** `Color/RED`
** `Color/GREEN`
** `Color/RED`

However, deeper hierarchies are possible, eg:

* `Size`
** `Size/SMALL`
*** `Size/SMALL/Smallest`
*** `Size/SMALL/Smaller`
*** `Size/SMALL/Small`
** `Size/MEDIUM`
** `Size/LARGE`
*** `Size/LARGE/Large`
*** `Size/LARGE/Larger`
*** `Size/LARGE/Largest`

There can be many such classification hierarchies; a given domain object can have multiple classifications, one per
hierarchy (but not more than one classification per hierarchy).  Thus, a domain object might be classified as both
`Color/RED` and `Size/MEDIUM`, but it isn't possible to classify as both `Color/RED` and `Color/GREEN`.

=== `Applicability` and `ApplicationTenancyRepository`

Not every domain object can be classified with respect to every hierarchy.  Instead, the available set is restricted by
the `Applicability` entity.  This identifies which ``Classification``(s) can be associated with domain object types.
This is further qualified by the application tenancy of the domain object (for multi-tenanted applications).  The
`ApplicationTenancyRepository` SPI service is used to obtain the application tenancy of each domain object.

=== `ClassifiableLink`

The `ClassifiableLink` is the tuple that represents the classification of the domain object.  Classifications can
optionally be specified to run over a period of time.


== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.classification</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-classification-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.13.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* in the `AppManifest`, update its `getModules()` method: +
+
[source,java]
----
@Override
public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
    return Arrays.asList(
            ...
            org.incode.module.classification.dom.ClassificationModule.class,
    );
}
----




Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-classification-dom[Maven Central Repo]).


==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.14.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo<;/id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----


=== For each domain object...

For each domain object that you want to classify (that is, to add classifications), you need to:

* implement a subclass of `ClassificationLink` for the domain object's type. +
+
This link acts as a type-safe tuple linking the domain object to the `Classification`.

* implement a domain event subscriber to correctly instantiate the subclass. +
+
Typically this is a nested static class of the `ClassificationLink` subtype.

For each such "classified" domain object, the module contribute the `classifications` collection, and also
contributes the `classify(...)` and `unclassify(...)` actions.

For example, in the demo app the `ClassifiableDemoObject` can be classified by virtue of the
`ClassifiableLinkForDemoObject` subclass:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable(
        identityType= IdentityType.DATASTORE,
        schema="classificationdemo")
@javax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceStrategy.NEW_TABLE)
@DomainObject(
        objectType = "classificationdemo.ClassifiableLinkForDemoObject"
)
public class ClassifiableLinkForDemoObject extends ClassifiableLink {            // <1>

    @DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
    @DomainServiceLayout(menuOrder = "1")
    public static class InstantiationSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {     // <2>
        @Programmatic
        @Subscribe
        public void on(final InstantiateEvent ev) {
            if(ev.getPolymorphicReference() instanceof ClassifiableDemoObject) {
                ev.setSubtype(ClassifiableLinkForDemoObject.class);
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void setPolymorphicReference(final Object polymorphicReference) {    // <3>
        super.setPolymorphicReference(polymorphicReference);
        setDemoObject((ClassifiableDemoObject) polymorphicReference);
    }

    private ClassifiableDemoObject demoObject;
    @Column(
            allowsNull = "false",
            name = "demoObjectId"
    )
    public ClassifiableDemoObject getDemoObject() {                                     // <4>
        return demoObject;
    }
    public void setDemoObject(final ClassifiableDemoObject demoObject) {
        this.demoObject = demoObject;
    }
}
----
<1> extend from `ClassifiableLink`
<2> implementation of a domain event subscriber that tells the `incode-module-classification` which subclass of
`ClassificationLink` to instantiate to handle the polymorphic link between `Classification` and the "classified"
domain object
<3> override the inherited `setPolymorphicReference(...)` method to allow the type-safe reference property to the
"classified" (in this case `ClassifiableDemoObject`) to be set
<4> the type-safe reference property to the "classified" domain object (in this case `ClassifiableDemoObject`).  In
the RDBMS this will correspond to a regular foreign key with referential integrity constraints correctly applied.





=== SPI services

There is one mandatory SPI domain service that must be implemented, namely the `ApplicationTenancyRepository`.  This
returns the application tenancy (path)s for a given classified object:

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationTenancyRepository {
    Collection<String> atPathsFor(final Object classified);
}
----


There can be multiple implementations of this interface.  This is to support the use case that different unrelated
entities in the application may be classified; each such classified implementation can have its own supporting
implementations of this SPI interface.




== Other Services

The module provides the following domain services for querying aliases:

* `ClassificationRepository` +
+
To search for existing ``Classification``s, and to create top-level ``Classification``s.  Children are created from
`Classification` itself.

* `ClassificationLinkRepository` +
+
To search for ``ClassificationLink``s, ie the tuple that links an `Classification` with an arbitrary "classified" domain object.  This repository allows for links to be searched by classified and optionally by date.



== Known issues

None at this time.

== Change Log

* `1.13.0` - released against Isis 1.13.0



== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `app` - the demo webapp's `AppManifest`
* `dom` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib
* `fixture` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts; depends on `dom`
* `integtests` - integration tests for the module; depends on `fixture`
* `webapp` - demo webapp (see above screenshots); depends on `dom` and `fixture`

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

Note that the module uses link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok].  To compile the code within your IDE you will
therefore require the appropriate Lombok plugin.  See the link:https://projectlombok.org/download.html[Lombok download page] for more information.

* http://github.com/isisaddons/isis-module-poly[Isis addons' poly] module

released under Apache v2 license.

==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.13.0 \
              1.14.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.13.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.  Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the 
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).  You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
