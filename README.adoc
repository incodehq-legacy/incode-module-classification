This module, intended for use with link:http://isis.apache.org[Apache Isis], provides the ability to classify any
(arbitrary) domain object against a pre-defined set of categorizations available for that type of domain object.  A
`CharacterizationCategory` defines a particular classification (similar to an enum), eg "PrivilegeLevel" and applies
to a specified domain type (eg Customer).  A `CharacterizationValue` is a particular value within that classification
(similar to an enum instance), eg "PrivilegeValue#GOLD", and applies to a specific instance of the domain type
(eg "John Doe: Customer").


== Screenshots

NOTE: TODO - need to update from here on...

The following screenshots show an example app's usage of the module.

We start by installing some demo fixture data:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/010-run-fixture-script.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/010-run-fixture-script.png"]

This installs some very simple (demo) `Aliasable` domain objects, the first of which is returned.  The `Aliasable` has
a (contributed) `aliases` collection, and we can also add new aliases using a (contributed) `addAlias(...)` action:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/040-add-alias.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/040-add-alias.png"]

The action requires the application tenancy of the alias (as returned from the `ApplicationTenancyRepository` SPI service) to be specified:

and also the alias type (as returned from the `AliasTypeRepository` SPI service) to be specified:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/052-enter-alias-details.png[link="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/incodehq/incode-module-classification/master/images/052-enter-alias-details.png"]

and finally the external alias reference itself must be specified also:

The aliases for the `Alias` domain object is added to:

Each `Alias` can also be viewed:

== How to run the Demo App

The prerequisite software is:

* Java JDK 8
* http://maven.apache.org[maven 3] (3.2.x or later is recommended).

To build the demo app:

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/incodehq/isis-module-alias.git
mvn clean install
----

To run the demo app:

[source]
----
mvn antrun:run -P self-host
----

Then log on using user: `sven`, password: `pass`


== How to configure/use

You can either use this module "out-of-the-box", or you can fork this repo and extend to your own requirements. 

=== "Out-of-the-box"

To use "out-of-the-box":

* update your classpath by adding this dependency in your dom project's `pom.xml`: +
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.incode.module.classification</groupId>
    <artifactId>incode-module-classification-dom</artifactId>
    <version>1.12.0</version>
</dependency>
----

* if using `AppManifest`, then update its `getModules()` method:

    @Override
    public List<Class<?>> getModules() {
        return Arrays.asList(
                ...
                org.incode.module.classification.dom.ClassificationModule.class,
        );
    }


* alternatively, in your project's `webapp` module, update your `WEB-INF/isis.properties`. +
+
[source,xml]
----
  isis.services.ServicesInstallerFromAnnotation.packagePrefix=\
                                ...\
                                org.incode.module.classification.dom,\
                                ...
----



Notes:

* Check for later releases by searching http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|incode-module-classification-dom[Maven Central Repo]).


==== "Out-of-the-box" (-SNAPSHOT)

If you want to use the current `-SNAPSHOT`, then the steps are the same as above, except:

* when updating the classpath, specify the appropriate -SNAPSHOT version:

[source,xml]
----
<version>1.13.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
----

* add the repository definition to pick up the most recent snapshot (we use the Cloudbees continuous integration service).  We suggest defining the repository in a `<profile>`:

[source,xml]
----
<profile>
    <id>cloudbees-snapshots</id>
    <activation>
        <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
    </activation>
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>snapshots-repo<;/id>
            <url>http://repository-estatio.forge.cloudbees.com/snapshot/</url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false>/enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
</profile>
----


=== For each domain object...

For each domain object that you want to be able to add aliases, you need to implement the `Aliasable` marker interface
and (optionally but strongly recommended) implement a subclass of `AliasableLink` to hold a type-safe reference back to
the domain object.

For each such `Aliasable` domain object, the module will then:

* contribute the `aliases` collection, and

* contribute the `addAlias(...)` and `removeAlias(...)` actions.

Other than implementing the marker interface, the `Aliasable` domain object will be completely decoupled from the rest
of the alias module.

In detail:

* have the domain object implement the `Aliasable` interface: +
+
For example, in the demo app the `AliasDemoObject` implements this interface: +
+
[source,java]
----
public class AliasDemoObject implements Aliasable {
    ...
}
----
+
This is a marker interface only (no methods need be implemented); it is used only so that Apache Isis knows where to
contribute the collections and actions.

* subclass the `AliasableLink` abstract class and also implement a domain event subscriber to correctly instantiate
the subclass.

For example, in the demo app the `AliasableLinkForDemoObject` implements both of these responsibilities:

[source,java]
----
@javax.jdo.annotations.PersistenceCapable(
        identityType= IdentityType.DATASTORE,
        schema="classificationdemo")
@javax.jdo.annotations.Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceStrategy.NEW_TABLE)
@DomainObject(
        objectType = "classificationdemo.AliasableLinkForDemoObject"
)
public class AliasableLinkForDemoObject extends AliasableLink {                  // <1>

    @DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)
    @DomainServiceLayout(menuOrder = "1")
    public static class InstantiationSubscriber extends AbstractSubscriber {     // <2>
        @Programmatic
        @Subscribe
        public void on(final InstantiateEvent ev) {
            if(ev.getPolymorphicReference() instanceof AliasDemoObject) {
                ev.setSubtype(AliasableLinkForDemoObject.class);
            }
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void setPolymorphicReference(final Aliasable polymorphicReference) {  // <3>
        super.setPolymorphicReference(polymorphicReference);
        setDemoObject((AliasDemoObject) polymorphicReference);
    }

    private AliasDemoObject demoObject;
    @Column(
            allowsNull = "false",
            name = "demoObjectId"
    )
    public AliasDemoObject getDemoObject() {                                     // <4>
        return demoObject;
    }
    public void setDemoObject(final AliasDemoObject demoObject) {
        this.demoObject = demoObject;
    }
}
----
<1> extend from `AliasableLink`
<2> implementation of a domain event subscriber that tells the `incode-module-classification` which subclass of `AliasableLink` to instantiate to handle the polymorphic link between `Alias` and the `Aliasable`.
<3> override the inherited `setPolymorphicReference(...)` method to allow the type-safe reference property to the `Aliasable` (in this case `AliasDemoObject`) to be set
<4> the type-safe reference property to the `Aliasable` (in this case `AliasDemoObject`).  In the RDBMS this will correspond to a regular foreign key with referential integrity constraints correctly applied.



=== SPI services

There are two mandatory SPI domain services that must be implemented.

First, the `ApplicationTenancyRepository` returns the application tenancy (path)s for a given aliasable:

[source,java]
----
public interface ApplicationTenancyRepository {
    Collection<String> atPathsFor(final Aliasable aliasable);
}
----

Second, the `AliasTypeRepository` interface returns the available alias types for a given application tenancy path and
aliasable:

[source,java]
----
public interface AliasTypeRepository {
    Collection<AliasType> aliasTypesFor(final Aliasable aliasable, final String atPath);
}
----

where `AliasType` is defined as the interface:
[source,java]
----
public interface AliasType {
    String getId();
}
----
Typically `AliasType` will be implemented as an entity or perhaps a view model.  The "id" is used as a column in
the database tables, but in the UI the end-user sees the title of the object that implements the interface.

[WARNING]
====
Currently (as of v1.11.1) the Apache Isis framework does not support enums implementing interfaces; the example app
shows how a view model can be used as a work-around.
====


Note that there can be multiple implementations of either of these interfaces.  This is to support the use case that
different unrelated entities in the application may implement `Aliasable`; each such `Aliasable` implementation can
 have its own supporting implementations.




== Other Services

The module provides the following domain services for querying aliases:

* `AliasRepository` +
+
To search for aliases by `Aliasable`

* `AliasableLinkRepository` +
+
To search for ``AliasableLink``s, ie the tuple that links an `Alias` with an arbitrary `Aliasable` domain object.
This repository allows for links to be searched by either aliasable, or application tenancy path, or alias type, in
any combination.



== Known issues

None at this time.

== Change Log

* `1.12.0` - released against Isis 1.12.0
* `1.11.1` - released against Isis 1.11.1.



== Forking the repo

If instead you want to extend this module's functionality, then we recommend that you fork this repo.  The repo is
structured as follows:

* `pom.xml` - parent pom
* `app` - the demo webapp's `AppManifest`
* `dom` - the module implementation, depends on Isis applib
* `fixture` - fixtures, holding a sample domain objects and fixture scripts; depends on `dom`
* `integtests` - integration tests for the module; depends on `fixture`
* `webapp` - demo webapp (see above screenshots); depends on `dom` and `fixture`

Only the `dom` project is released to Maven Central Repo.  The versions of the other modules are purposely left at
`0.0.1-SNAPSHOT` because they are not intended to be released.

Note that the module uses link:https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok].  To compile the code within your IDE you will
therefore require the appropriate Lombok plugin.  See the link:https://projectlombok.org/download.html[Lombok download page] for more information.

both released under Apache v2 license.


=== Icons

The icon for the `Alias` entity is provided by https://icons8.com/[Icons8].


==  Maven deploy notes

Only the `dom` module is deployed, and is done so using Sonatype's OSS support (see
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html[user guide]).

=== Release to Sonatype's Snapshot Repo

To deploy a snapshot, use:

[source]
----
pushd dom
mvn clean deploy
popd
----

The artifacts should be available in Sonatype's
https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots[Snapshot Repo].



=== Release to Maven Central

The `release.sh` script automates the release process. It performs the following:

* performs a sanity check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything builds ok
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version, and tag
* performs a double check (`mvn clean install -o`) that everything still builds ok
* releases the code using `mvn clean deploy`
* bumps the `pom.xml` to a specified release version

For example:

[source]
----
sh release.sh 1.13.0 \
              1.14.0-SNAPSHOT \
              dan@haywood-associates.co.uk \
              "this is not really my passphrase"
----

where
* `$1` is the release version
* `$2` is the snapshot version
* `$3` is the email of the secret key (`~/.gnupg/secring.gpg`) to use for signing
* `$4` is the corresponding passphrase for that secret key.

Other ways of specifying the key and passphrase are available, see the `pgp-maven-plugin`'s
http://kohsuke.org/pgp-maven-plugin/secretkey.html[documentation]).

If the script completes successfully, then push changes:

[source]
----
git push origin master
git push origin 1.13.0
----

If the script fails to complete, then identify the cause, perform a `git reset --hard` to start over and fix the issue
before trying again.  Note that in the `dom`'s `pom.xml` the `nexus-staging-maven-plugin` has the 
`autoReleaseAfterClose` setting set to `true` (to automatically stage, close and the release the repo).  You may want
to set this to `false` if debugging an issue.

According to Sonatype's guide, it takes about 10 minutes to sync, but up to 2 hours to update http://search.maven.org[search].
